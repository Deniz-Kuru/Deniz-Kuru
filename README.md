## Deniz Kuru 

🎓 Hoping to graduate from McGill in the next two years  
🧗 I climb plastic rocks for fun and injuries  
🎾 I pretend I’m good at tennis  
🦍 Fond of gorillas & boardgames

⚠️ None of the code here will be useful to anyone but me.  
⚠️ If you see a security feature, know that it's unsafe.

🔭 I’m planning on making a game mixing Kingdom Newlands vibes and the Istanbul boardgame mechanics.  
🎨 Making assets is hard… I haven’t started  
🌱 Learning T-SQL & Kafka at work, Godot at home  

🤔 Looking for help with: climbing V6s

🌳 Also: I half-built a giant Adventure Time treehouse in Minecraft survival
